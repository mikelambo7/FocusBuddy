Hey, Focus! Buddy! Remember, I’m not just yelling at you to focus—I’m also your trusty Focus Buddy, here to keep you on track! :)

Focus Buddy is an app to help you monitor your attention spans during online sessions or lectures. The app provides you with real-time feedback, alerting you if you look away from the screen for too long. Additionally, it'll help track and visualize your attention patterns over time.
